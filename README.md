# Sentiment Analysis
This repository as for now is only for tracking our work, not to be used explicitly by others until and unless LICENCE is provided.
Project based on learning in CN.



For making training data, we used list of positive and negative words from General Enquirer data set, then using those words, we found their hyponymns and hypernymns using WordNet. Then Using WordNet we found all these words' sentences/examples which eventually built our training dataset. Then after some preprocessing we found WordCloud of positive examples and negative examples as follows:

**Positive WordCloud**
