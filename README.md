For making taining data, we used list of positive and negative words from General Enquirer data set, then using those words, we found theie hyponymns and hyponymns using WordNet. Then Using WordNet we found all these word' sentences/examples which eventually built our training dataset. Then after some preprocessing we found WordCloud of positive examples and negative examples as follows:

                                              **Positive WordCloud**

                                              **Negative WordCloud**

--- Testing Time using such data!
